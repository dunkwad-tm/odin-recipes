<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
    In 2001, Regina Schrambling went on a week long odyssey
     in search of the best lasagna recipe. Her ideal here has 
     an intensely flavored sauce, cheeses melted into creaminess
      as if they were bechamel, meat that’s just chunky enough
       and noodles that put up no resistance to the fork.

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>2 medium red onions, finely diced</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>

            For the sauce, heat ½ cup oil in a large heavy Dutch oven
             or kettle over low heat. Add the onions, minced garlic and
              pancetta, and cook, stirring, for 10 minutes, until the
               onions are wilted. Season liberally with salt and pepper.
                Raise heat slightly, add the wine and cook until it is
                 mostly reduced, about 20 minutes. Crush the tomatoes
                  into the pan, and add their juice. Add the tomato 
                  paste and 2 cups lukewarm water. Simmer for 1 hour.

            Combine the sirloin, cheese and eggs in a large bowl.
            Chop the parsley with the whole garlic until fine, then
            stir into the beef mixture. Season lavishly with salt
            and pepper. Using your hands, mix until all the ingredients
                are well blended. Shape into meatballs and set aside.
